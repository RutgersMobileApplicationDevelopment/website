                        The goal of the Accelerator is to take students from knowing
                        nothing about app development to a level where they can build and
                        ship their own apps. They will pick a track from
                        <b style="color: #4b0082;">iOS, Android, or Backend</b>
                        development to learn about.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We will also provide every mentee in The Accelerator program with
                        close mentorship from an experienced mentor. They will receive
                        career and academic guidance to help ensure they are successful in
                        their journey at
                        <b style="color: #f22c50;">Rutgers</b> and beyond.
